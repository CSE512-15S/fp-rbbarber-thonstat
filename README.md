#H1 Visualizing Hydrophone Data
##H6 Ramona Barber, Travis Thonstad {rbbarber, thonstat}@uw.edu
Underwater noise generated by river, ocean or tidal turbines has the potential to affect fish and marine life. The noise may lead to injury, avoidance, attraction or behavioral modifications. It is essential to understand the relationship between turbine placement and noise generated to inform design and siting decisions.

The visualization explores the way different frequency bands of the recorded signals attenuate in the spatial domain for different turbine operating conditions, and asks if this is affected by the shape and depth of the riverbed, the frequency of the signal, or other conditions. The visualization is created for experts in the field as a tool to inform design and siting decisions. Several separate, dynamically linked images convey both the frequency characteristics of the hydrophone signal and how the magnitude of the recorded pressures change with distance from the turbine.
* The user can choose the frequency range and the data record by brushing and selecting.
* The cross-flow amplitudes along the hydrophoneâ€™s path can be selected by brushing.
* Linking between the panels helps the user stay oriented across the multiple windows.
